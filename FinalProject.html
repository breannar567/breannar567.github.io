    	  <p style="color:seagreen">Elephants are rapidly disappearing from their habitats, this being because poachers will <br>stop at nothing to obtain ivory from elephant tusks. Even though most areas have <br>outlawed the poaching of elephants for their tusks, poachers continue to hunt them. <br> Elephants will become extinct if we don't do something about this soon.</p>
    	  
    	<p style="color:seagreen"> Across Africa, elephants attract tourists  that bring in the funding responsible for <br> protecting wildlife areas. Elephants are very important to their environment because <br> when they eat, they creat gaps in vegetation, allowing new plants to grow for smaller <br> animals to eat. </p>
